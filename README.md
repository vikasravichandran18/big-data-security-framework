📌 Overview
In the era of big data, ensuring security, privacy, and compliance is a critical challenge. This project demonstrates a prototype framework for securing sensitive data, implementing access control, logging activities for compliance, and meeting regulations such as GDPR’s Right to Erasure.

The framework is built in Python and is designed to be run in Google Colab or any Python environment. It encrypts data before storage, controls who can access it, maintains a compliance log, and supports secure deletion of data.

This is a proof-of-concept system, useful for understanding how security and compliance can be integrated into big data pipelines.

🎯 Objectives
The primary objectives of this project are:

Data Encryption – Ensure that sensitive information is encrypted both at rest and in transit.

Access Control – Restrict access to data based on predefined user roles.

Compliance Checking – Automatically validate data handling against common privacy laws.

Audit Logging – Maintain a log of access attempts and system events for transparency and accountability.

Scalability & Adaptability – Make it easy to extend the framework to integrate with enterprise-grade big data platforms.

🚀 Features
Data Encryption

Uses the cryptography library with the Fernet symmetric encryption method.

All sensitive information is encrypted before storage.

Secure Key Management

Generates a unique encryption key and stores it securely.

In a production environment, keys should be kept in a secure key vault.

Access Control

Only authorized users can decrypt and view sensitive data.

Unauthorized access attempts are logged.

Compliance Logging

Every access, modification, or deletion is logged with a timestamp.

Logs are stored in a CSV file for easy auditing.

GDPR Compliance

Implements the Right to Erasure by securely deleting stored user data.

🔐 Security Notes
This prototype uses file-based storage for keys and encrypted data.

In a real-world system:

Store keys in a secure vault (e.g., AWS KMS, Azure Key Vault).

Use secure databases instead of local files.

Implement multi-factor authentication for sensitive operations.

📈 Future Enhancements
Integration with big data platforms like Hadoop or Spark.

Real-time compliance dashboards.

Role-based access control (RBAC) with granular permissions.

Integration with SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) tools.
